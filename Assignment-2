1. Create a file like nano file1.txt
----
#cmd: 
      echo "this is a file" > file1.txt
----

2. Now we will copy date from file1 to new file2
o cp file1.txt file2.txt
o Then see the output of file2.txt, cat file2.txt
----
#cmd: 
     cp file1.txt file2.txt 
     cat file2.txt 
----
3. Now we will move the file2.txt to new folder /home
----
#cmd: 
     cp file2.txt home 
     ls -lrt home/file2.txt 
----
4. Then we create a new file3.txt and file4.txt in home directory and add
content in it.
o Now do echo “Hello I am newline” > file3.txt and provide the
output of file3.txt
o Now do echo “Hello I am newline” >> file4.txt and provide the
output of file4.txt

o Tell the different between both step you follow and the reason
behind it
#Ans: 
  1. when we use echo "some content with > " > file.txt, then it means that it will remove existing content and put the new content that we are echoing.
  2. when we use echo "some content with >>" >> file.txt, then it means that it will append the content to the existing content, unlike (>) which removes previous content.


-----
#cmd: 
     echo “Hello I am newline in file3” > file3.txt
     echo “Hello I am newline in file4” >> file4.txt
     
      cat file3.txt file4.txt 
“Hello I am newline in file3”
“Hello I am newline in file4”
----

5. For remove a file or directory you can use the below two commands

----
#cmd
    rm file1.txt
